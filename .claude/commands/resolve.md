# Resolve

Fetch PR review comments and implement ALL requested changes systematically.

## Workflow

1. **FETCH COMMENTS**: Gather all unresolved PR feedback
   - **Identify PR**: `gh pr status --json number,headRefName`
   - **Get reviews**: `gh pr review list --state CHANGES_REQUESTED`
   - **Get inline**: `gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/comments`
   - **CRITICAL**: Capture BOTH review comments AND inline code comments
   - **STOP** if no PR found - ask user for PR number

2. **ANALYZE & PLAN**: Map feedback to specific actions
   - **Extract locations**: Note exact file:line references
   - **Group by file**: Batch changes for MultiEdit efficiency
   - **Define scope**: List ONLY files from review comments
   - **STAY IN SCOPE**: NEVER fix unrelated issues
   - **Create checklist**: One item per comment to track

3. **IMPLEMENT FIXES**: Address each comment systematically
   - **BEFORE editing**: ALWAYS `Read` target file first
   - **Batch changes**: Use `MultiEdit` for same-file modifications
   - **Verify resolution**: Each comment MUST be fully addressed
   - **Direct fixes only**: Make EXACTLY what reviewer requested
   - **Track progress**: Check off each resolved comment

4. **COMMIT & PUSH**: Submit all fixes as single commit
   - **Stage everything**: `git add -A`
   - **Commit format**: `fix: address PR review comments`
   - **Push changes**: `git push` to update the PR
   - **NEVER include**: No "Generated with Claude Code" or co-author tags
   - **Verify**: Check PR updated with `gh pr view`

## Execution Rules

- **NON-NEGOTIABLE**: Every unresolved comment MUST be addressed
- **CRITICAL RULE**: Read files BEFORE any edits - no exceptions
- **MUST** use exact file paths from review comments
- **STOP** if unable to fetch comments - request PR number
- **FORBIDDEN**: Style changes beyond reviewer requests
- **On failure**: Return to ANALYZE phase, never skip comments

## Project Context

SaaS boilerplate specifics:

- Layered architecture (DAL, services, facades)
- Strict TypeScript + ESLint + Prettier
- Vitest tests with pool=forks
- Next.js 15 App Router structure
- Stripe and Better Auth integrations

## Priority

**Reviewer requests > Everything else**. STAY IN SCOPE - fix ONLY what was requested.
